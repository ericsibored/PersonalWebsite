Experimenting with the Monochromatic Template

Hello!

This repository is a pitstop in my road to learning basic web development for a workshop on cloud hosting personal websites.

https://www.freewebtemplates.com/download/free-website-template/monochromed-967946512/

I am not an expert in web development (literally started last week) so this is a learn as you go type deal with both GitHub, Azure, and HTML/CSS/JS
